## Introduction 

This repository, Machine Learning Project, serves as a collection of early-stage machine learning experiments and learning exercises. It was created to explore fundamental concepts and practical applications of machine learning algorithms.

While this repository holds historical significance, it's important to note that it represents a snapshot of my early learning journey. As my skills and knowledge have evolved, I've embarked on more complex and ambitious projects.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and code within this repository to gain insights into foundational machine learning techniques. However, for the latest and most advanced projects, please refer to my other repositories.

### Installing

To run each project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can easily install them by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your project's dependencies are installed correctly and consistently.
