## Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, often used for classification tasks. It includes three flower species with 50 samples each, as well as some properties about each flower.

One species of flower is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

For each sample, four features were measured:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

### Installing

To set up your environment, simply install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that your project's dependencies are installed correctly and consistently.
